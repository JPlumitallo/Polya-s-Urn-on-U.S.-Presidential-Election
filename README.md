# Polya-s-Urn-on-U.S.-Presidential-Election

This program was written in a feverish and hurried fashion just moments afore the U.S. presidential election. This was constructed in an attempt to (both unprofessionally and crudely) employ George PÃ³lya's "Polya's Urn" statistical method to audit the results of the election.

This was chiefly a programming exercise rather than either a functional or realistic application of Polya's Urn.
