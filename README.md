# Polya-s-Urn-on-U.S.-Presidential-Election

This program was written in a feverish and hurried fashion just moments afore the U.S. presidential election. This was constructed in an attempt to (both unprofessionally and crudely) employ George Pólya's "Polya's Urn" statistical method to audit the results of the election.

This was chiefly a programming exercise rather than a functional or realistic application of Polya's Urn.
